         Endangered species are those plants and animals that have 
         become so rare they are in danger of becoming extinct. 
         Threatened species are plants and animals that are likely to 
         become endangered within the foreseeable future throughout all 
         or a significant portion of its range.

            <li>South China Tiger</li>
            <p>Of all tiger subspecies, the South China tiger may be at the greatest 
               risk of extinction. The WWF estimates there are just 30 to 80 South China 
               tigers left in the world, all of which are in captivity; the South China 
               tiger hasn't been seen in the wild in over a quarter-century.
            </p>
            <li>African Forest Elephant</li>
            <p>The conservation status of populations varies across range countries. 
               Since 2021, the species has been listed as Critically Endangered on the IUCN Red List.
